LIFX plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

_**This is the first lifx plugin that officially supports adaptive lighting ‚òÄÔ∏è | üåë**_
   
A plugin that automatically adds Lifx bulbs on the network to the Homebridge instead of tediously registering the lights individually via homekit.

This plugin will be updated regularly in the future, because I see it as a small heart task and use it personally. 

The reason to create this plugin was the use of several published already existing lifx-plugins for homebridge and the anger struggeling with lifx and homekit. Unfortunately, all the plugins I tested slowed down homebridge so I couldn't access my devices from outside my network.
This plugin should fix that problem and add some extra functionality

Also, lights that were not connected to the power were marked as "not responding".
This plugin automatically sets the status of these lights to offline as soon as the light can no longer be reached.
   
I appreciate anyone who would like to use my plugin and welcome comments of any kind.

Of course, sometimes no error is left out, so forgive me if you might have problems and stay tuned. Updates will follow as soon as possible!

## üöÄ Quick Start

 ### 1. **Installation**

```console
npm i homebridge-lifx-plugin
```

or use the awesome [Homebridge Config Ui X plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x)
   
<img width="250" alt="settings" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94163719/149901919-8fcd4673-c8a9-4ba3-8b60-7b511d06a7fe.png" align="right">
  
### 2. **Setup**
   
To make sure your bulbs are automatically detected, enter your correct broadcast address in advanced settings.
If you don't know what broadcast address means, [have a look at this comment](https://github.com/calvarium/homebridge-lifx-plugin/issues/9#issuecomment-1028757142).
   
You can retrieve your broadcast address with the following command:
   
***Windows***
```console
ipconfig
```
  
***Mac/Linux***
```console
ifconfig
```
   
All settings can be configured in the [Homebridge Plugin Settings GUI](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/wiki/Developers:-Plugin-Settings-GUI)

All options can be found under [Settings](#‚öôÔ∏è-settings)   
<br clear="right"/>


### 3. **Enjoy** üòéüí°

All Lifx bulbs accessible on the network will be added to your homekit automatically.
So go outside, configure your lights, create scenes and automations. Enjoy your lifeüßò

|Color Duration         |`colorDuration`  |`integer`  |0...‚àû       |300|Time to fade in milliseconds for changing color

### Bulbs

Adding bulbs separately is useful for networks where broadcasting is not possible or if you do not want the plugin to discover all bulbs automatically.
If autoDiscover is enabled the separately added bulbs are not added a second time.

|Title                  |Name    |Type       |Value         |Default|Description
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------
|Name          |`name`  |`string`   |any   ||Name for recognizing the bulb
|Address   |`address`  |`string`  |ip    ||IP address of the bulb to be added separately
### Excludes

You can now create exceptions for your bulbs that should not be registered with broadcasting

|Title                  |Name    |Type       |Value         |Default|Description
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------
|Name          |`name`  |`string`   |any   ||Name for recognizing the bulb
|Address   |`address`  |`string`  |ip    ||IP address of the bulb to be excluded
